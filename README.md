# NJOY vs FRENDY Cross Section Comparison

This repository provides a framework for comparing evaluated nuclear data processed by two major nuclear data processing systems: **[NJOY](https://github.com/njoy/NJOY2016)** and **[FRENDY](https://rpg.jaea.go.jp/main/en/program_frendy/)**.

## üìò Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Process ENDF-formatted nuclear data files using both NJOY and FRENDY.
- Extract and visualize ACE-format cross section data.
- Perform a systematic comparison between the two outputs.
- Identify discrepancies and evaluate consistency across different energy groups and reactions.
